# atwork_commander

Complete reimplementation of a Refery Box (Refbox) for the @Work-League of the RoboCup.

This Refbox is a native ROS application. However it aims to enable multiple communications backends through individual plugins.

Additionally, a RViz GUI will be developed, which provides enhanced visualization capabiliities for referies and visitors / spectators.

## TODOs
